Hi üëã I am Aishwarya and I love to learn. I studied Computer Science and Economics at UMass Amherst. I have professional experience in data science, data management, building data pipelines, and curating creative visualizations. 

I like to read about research in machine learning and computation. I love to write content for a general technical audience on my [blog](https://medium.com/@platform-10). My goal is to explain concepts, model architecture, performance, and takeaways in a simpler way. I also like to make keychains out of old CPUs and other PCBs.

Projects
-----
**ResNet50 Applications: Sidewalk Cracks:** *Keras, PyTorch*

Utilized pre-trained ResNet50 with ImageNet weights to build a classifier to detect whether a given image of a sidwalk contains a crack. 


**Scents and Sensibility: Fragrance Recommendation:** *AWS Sagemaker, TensorFlow, Sklearn, Selenium*

Scraped data from fragrantica.com about fragrances. Normalized and cleaned data by aggregating customer ratings of the fragrance. Computed fragrance similarity using top, middle, and base notes. Used Sagemaker to deploy an inference pipeline into production. Monitored metrics on Sagemaker.

**DeepLearning.AI Data Engineering Capstone:** *AWS Glue, Apache Iceberg, Redshift, Terraform, dbt, Airflow*

Extracted and transformed semi-structured data from Spotify API and relational data from operational databases. Developed a 3-tier data lake, using Iceberg for transformation, Redshift Spectrum and dbt for serving, and Glue and Terraform for orchestration

**DataOps Bastion Host Implementation:** *AWS - EC2, RDS, Cloud9, Route 53, Terraform*

Configured private subnets for data resources and public subnets for the bastion host. Utilized NAT Gateway for internet access. Created corresponding SSH key pairs for the bastion host's connectivity. Configured security groups to ensure proper access.

**Streaming Queries with Flink:** *Apache Flink, Apache Zeppelin, AWS Managed Streaming for Kafka (MSK)*

Sourced MSK topic to query and transform data in Zeppelin. Created UDFs for generating stock ticker data

**Central Logging Monitor:** *React, Cypress, SpringBoot*

Served as an integration liaison for a workflow monitoring tool, allowing drill-down functionality for ISO New England. Wrote integration tests with Cypress, covering page routing and redirects
